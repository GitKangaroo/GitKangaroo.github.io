Hello! I am an Experimental Particle Physicist working at Imperial College London and currently a member of the [LHCb](https://www.home.cern/science/experiments/lhcb) experiment.

I obtained my DPhil degree in Accelerator Neutrino Physics from the University of Oxford in 2023. I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in Physics from the University of Manchester between 2015 and 2019.
