    abstract={The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) utilizes Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology 
    in its pursuit of uncovering the origins of matter. As a crucial prototype for the DUNE far detector (FD) module, 
    ProtoDUNE-SP at CERN Neutrino Platform Facility employs a hadron test beam with a momentum range of 0.3 to 7 GeV/c 
    to study the detector response to particles that could be produced in the neutrino interactions at the DUNE FD. 
    Furthermore, ProtoDUNE-SP is dedicated to testing event reconstruction and performing detector calibration under 
    controlled conditions. Neutral pion reconstruction performance is an important benchmark of the calorimetric and tracking 
    capability of LArTPC, and understanding neutral pion in LArTPC is crucial to characterize backgrounds to oscillation 
    measurements and rare searches. To improve neutral pion reconstruction in LArTPC, a kinematic fitting algorithm is 
    developed, achieving a 12% resolution in neutral pion energy in ProtoDUNE-SP. 
    This enhancement enables the first measurements of the pion-argon charge exchange differential cross-section. 
    By com- paring these results with the current model, valuable constraints can be made to improve generator simulations 
    in the future DUNE experiment.},

   abstract={We introduce the MINERvA Analysis Toolkit (MAT), a utility for centralizing the handling of
      systematic uncertainties in HEP analyses. The fundamental utilities of the toolkit are the MnvHnD,
      a powerful histogram container class, and the systematic Universe classes, which provide a modular
      implementation of the many universe error analysis approach. These products can be used standalone or as part of a complete error analysis prescription. They support the propagation of systematic
      uncertainty through all stages of analysis, and provide flexibility for an arbitrary level of user
      customization. This extensible solution to error analysis enables the standardization of systematic
      uncertainty definitions across an experiment and a transparent user interface to lower the barrier to
      entry for new analyzers.},
